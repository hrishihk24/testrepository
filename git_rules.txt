This error means that the directory you are working in is not recognized as a Git repository. Hereâ€™s how you can troubleshoot and fix it:

### **1. Make Sure You Are in a Git Repository**
Run:
```sh
git status
```
If you see the error again, it means you are not inside a Git repository. Navigate to the correct project directory where Git is initialized.

### **2. Check If the `.git` Folder Exists**
Run:
```sh
ls -la
```
or on Windows:
```sh
dir /a
```
If there is no `.git` directory, it means Git is not initialized in this folder.

### **3. Reinitialize Git (If Needed)**
If you accidentally deleted the `.git` folder or if Git was never initialized, you need to reinitialize the repository:
```sh
git init
```
Then, add your remote repository again:
```sh
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
```

### **4. If You Were Inside a Subdirectory**
If the repository is in a parent directory, move up the directory tree:
```sh
cd ..
git status
```
Repeat until you find the Git repository.

### **5. Clone the Repository Again (If Necessary)**
If you lost the repository locally, you might need to re-clone it:
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```
