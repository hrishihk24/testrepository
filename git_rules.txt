### **2. Check If the `.git` Folder Exists**

ls -la

or on Windows:

dir /a


If there is no `.git` directory, it means Git is not initialized in this folder.

### **3. Reinitialize Git (If Needed)**
If you accidentally deleted the `.git` folder or if Git was never initialized, you need to reinitialize the repository:

git init

Then, add your remote repository again:

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>


### **4. If You Were Inside a Subdirectory**
If the repository is in a parent directory, move up the directory tree:

cd ..
git status

Repeat until you find the Git repository.

### **5. Clone the Repository Again (If Necessary)**
If you lost the repository locally, you might need to re-clone it:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

git restore --staged "New Text Document.txt"      -- after git add command, if you want to unstage it, use this.
Same can be done using
git rest [file name]

git diff --staged       --used to see the diff between unstaged and staged docs i.e.before and after commit command.


BRANCH & MERGE
==============

git branch -- will give list of all branches

git branch [new branch name] --will create a new branch

git checkout [new branch name] -- will switch from the main branch to the new branch.

Do all the work and now we want to merge the commit to the main branch.
Fisrt check out to the main branch.

git checkout main

git merger [new branch name]       ---

next push it
git push origin main


git log -- shows the log previous commits.

git log -p -3               --- if we need only last 3 commits.
